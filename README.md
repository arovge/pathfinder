# pathfinder
### This is some JavaFX application I made to play with path finding algorithms

##### minor things that i want to fix
* when starting to hold down shift or control, a rectangle does not change color unless the cursor moves to a new rectangle (can be fixed by using keymoved, but it is not instant. key still needs to move on the rectangle)
