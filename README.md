This is some JavaFX application I made to play with path finding algorithms.

### What it is
This is a JavaFX application. All of the squares are added to the window dynamically and have their event filters added before being added.

The user can select what path finding algorithm they would like to use to traverse the intractable map.

### Controls
Below are the controls that can be used with a mouse:
* Left Click - Draw Walls
* Right Click - Erase
* Left Click + SHIFT - Set start square
* Left Click + CONTROL - Set end square

The user is able to select what path finding variables they would like to be enabled from the top menu.

### Future Development
##### Features
* The execution time is poor due to a flaw in how the program does the pathfinding. The state/pathfinding system should be redone before any future development is done.
